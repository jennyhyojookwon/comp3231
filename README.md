# Assignment 03
- System calls and processes

In this assignment you will be implementing a software bridge between a set of file-related system calls inside the OS/161 kernel and their implementation within the VFS (obviously also inside the kernel). Upon completion, your operating system will be able to run a single application at user-level and perform some basic file I/O.
A substantial part of this assignment is understanding how OS/161 works and determining what code is required to implement the required functionality. Expect to spend at least as long browsing and digesting OS/161 code as actually writing and debugging your own code.



# Assignment 04
- Virtual memory

In this assignment you will implement the virtual memory sub-system of OS/161. The existing VM implementation in OS/161, dumbvm, is a minimal implementation with a number of shortcomings. In this assignment you will adapt OS/161 to take full advantage of the simulated hardware by implementing management of the MIPS software-managed Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). You will write the code to manage this TLB.
